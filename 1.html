    <h1>Start Weatherizing Your Home</h1>
    <h2>Air Sealing</h2>
    <p>Air leaks are among the greatest sources of energy loss in a home. One of the quickest energy- and
      money-saving tasks you can do is caulk, seal, and weatherstrip all seams, cracks, and openings to the outside.
      By sealing uncontrolled air leaks, you can save 10%–20% on your heating and cooling bills. Following your
      energy audit, you may have a number of recommended energysaving projects you are considering. Prioritize
      weatherization projects to quickly improve the efficiency and comfort of your home.</p>
    <h2>Insulation</h2>
    <p>After you complete air sealing, consider whether you need to add insulation. Insulation is essential for
      reducing heat flow through a home’s building envelope (the parts of the home that separate the interior from
      the outside elements, including the walls, roof, and foundation). The
      greater the difference between the indoor and the outdoor temperatures, the more energy it will take to
      maintain a comfortable temperature in your home. Adding insulation between the indoors and the outdoors
      reduces that energy demand, improves the comfort of your home, and saves you money.
