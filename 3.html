    <h1>Go Green With Your Daily Commute</h1>
    <p>The vehicle you choose and how you drive that vehicle affect your fuel use and transportation costs. Efficient
      driving choices can save you money.</p>
    <h2>Saving Money on Fuel</h2>
    <p>The following tips can help you improve your gas mileage or avoid using gas altogether.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Minimize idling your car by turning off your engine when your vehicle is parked. Any shutdown longer than 1
        minute will save you money, but try not to exceed 10 engine starts per day. Idling can use a quarter to a half
        gallon of fuel per hour, depending on engine size and air conditioner use.</li>
      <li>Also avoid idling to warm your engine in the winter. Most manufacturers recommend driving off gently after
        about 30 seconds. The engine will warm up faster being driven, which will allow the heat to turn on sooner and
        decrease your fuel costs.</li>
      <li>In hot weather, roll down the windows at lower speeds and use the air conditioning (AC) at highway speeds.
      </li>
      <li>Before turning on the AC, roll down the windows briefly to let hot air out of the cabin. Turn on the AC with
        the windows closed after you begin driving; it will cool the vehicle faster.</li>
      <li>Avoid aggressive driving, such as speeding, rapid acceleration, and hard braking. Aggressive driving can lower
        your highway gas mileage by up to 30% and your city mileage by 40%.</li>
      <li>Avoid high speeds. Driving above 50 mph, gas mileage drops rapidly.</li>
      <li>Reduce drag by placing items inside the car or trunk rather than on roof racks, which can decrease your fuel
        economy by up to 8% in city driving and up to 25% at Interstate speeds.
        Avoid keeping heavy items in your car; an extra 100 pounds in your vehicle reduces your miles per gallon by
        about 1%.
      </li>
      <li>Combine errands. Several short trips taken from a cold start can use twice as much fuel as one trip covering
        the same distance when the engine is warm. </li>
      <li>Use cruise control on the highway to maintain a constant speed and save gas. </li>
      <li>Check into telecommuting, carpooling, public transit, and active transportation like bicycling or walking to
        save on fuel and car maintenance costs. Many urban areas provide carpool lanes that are usually less congested,
        further improving your fuel economy.</li>
      <li>If your vehicle has an “economy” mode, ensure that it is turned on.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Buying and Driving Fuel-Efficient and Alternative Fuel Vehicles</h2>
    <p>When purchasing a vehicle, consider fuel-efficient and alternative fuel vehicles. Use the tips and tools below to
      select the right vehicle for you and to get the most out of your purchase. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose your vehicle according to your needs. If you mostly drive in cities, a smaller hybrid electric vehicle
        might be right for you because it gets better mileage in city driving and is easier to park. If you have more
        than one vehicle available to you, drive the most fuel-efficient vehicle whenever possible. </li>
      <li>If you need a vehicle for towing or heavy use, consider a clean diesel vehicle. Diesel engines are more
        powerful and 30%–35% more efficient than similar-sized gasoline engines. New diesel engines are much smoother
        and quieter than their predecessors. The new generation of clean diesel vehicles must meet the same emissions
        standards as gasoline vehicles. Drivers of diesel vehicles can be even more sustainable by fueling up with a
        biodiesel blend. Most manufacturers allow the use of B5 (diesel with up to 5% biodiesel), and some accept the
        use of B20 (diesel with up to 20% biodiesel).</li>
      <li>Many vehicles produced by U.S. auto manufacturers are flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs), which can run on E85 (up
        to 85% ethanol, 15% gasoline) and other ethanol-gasoline blends. Check your owner’s manual to find out if your
        vehicle is an FFV.</li>
      <li>Consider buying a highly fuel-efficient vehicle. A fuel-efficient, hybrid electric, plug-in electric, or other
        alternative fuel vehicle could cut your fuel costs. Visit <a href="FuelEconomy.gov">FuelEconomy.gov</a> and use
        the Find a Car tool when
        buying a new fuel-efficient car or truck.</li>
      <li>If you have a plug-in hybrid electric or an all-electric vehicle, charging stations for electric vehicles are
        increasingly available throughout the country. You can find charging and alternative fuel stations on the
        Alternative Fueling Station Locator: <a
          href="afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/">afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/</a>.</li>
      <li>For plug-in electric vehicles, keep the battery charged. For plug-in hybrids, you’ll minimize the gas you use.
        For electric vehicles, you’ll maximize your driving range.</li>
    </ol>
