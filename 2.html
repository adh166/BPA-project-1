    <h1>Heat and Cool Your Home Efficiently</h1>
    <p>Did You Know? Heating and cooling together are the largest energy users in your home, typically making up about
      35%–40% of your energy use.</p>
    <h2>Smart and Programmable Thermostats</h2>
    <p>Being smart about how you control your temperature settings will help you save money and stay comfortable in your
      home. You can save as much as 10% per year on heating and cooling by turning your thermostat down 7°–10°F for 8
      hours a day in the fall and winter; turn it up in the spring and summer. (If you have a heat pump, don’t do this
      without a smart or programmable thermostat designed for use with heat pumps.) A smart thermostat is a Wi-Fi
      enabled device that automatically adjusts heating and cooling temperature settings for optimal performance. Smart
      thermostats that earn the ENERGY STAR label have been independently certified, based on actual field data, to
      deliver energy savings.</p>
    <h2>Air Ducts</h2>
    <p>Air ducts are one of the most important systems in your home, as they carry the air from your home’s furnace and
      central air conditioner to each room. If the ducts are poorly sized, poorly sealed, or poorly insulated, they are
      likely contributing to higher energy bills. You can often address discomfort from heating and cooling by fixing
      blocked registers, stuck dampers, or disconnected or damaged ducts, or by replacing register grilles that don’t
      direct the air adequately. Ducts that leak air into an attic or crawl space can add hundreds of dollars a year to
      your heating and cooling bills. Insulating and sealing ducts in unconditioned spaces is usually very cost
      effective. If the supply ducts are leaking, heated or cooled air can be forced out of unsealed joints and lost. In
      addition, unconditioned air can be drawn into return ducts through unsealed joints.</p>
    <h2>Water Heating</h2>
    <p>Water heating is the second largest energy expense in your home. It typically accounts for about 13% of your
      energy usage. There are four primary ways to cut your water heating bills: use less hot water; turn down the
      thermostat on your water heater; insulate your water heater and pipes; or buy a new, more efficient model.</p>
    <h2>Reducing Water Heating Costs</h2>
    <p>You can take steps to use less hot water and improve the efficiency of your existing water heating system.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If your hot water tank is warm to the touch, consider insulating it to save 7%–16% annually in water heating
        costs. Follow manufacturer recommendations. </li>
      <li>Consider insulating your hot water pipes. Doing so can reduce heat loss, allow you lower the temperature
        setting, and save an additional 3%–4% per year on water heating.</li>
      <li>Set your water heater temperature to 120ºF, a temperature considered safe for most of the population.</li>
      <li>Install heat traps on the hot and cold pipes at the water heater to prevent heat loss. Most new water heaters
        have built-in heat traps.</li>
      <li>Drain a quart of water from your water tank every 3 months to remove sediment that impedes heat transfer and
        lowers the efficiency of your heater. Follow the manufacturer’s directions. </li>
      <li>Consider installing a drain-water waste heat recovery system. Drain-water, or greywater, heat recovery systems
        capture the energy from waste hot water— such as showers and dishwashers—to preheat cold water entering the
        water heater or going to other water fixtures. Energy savings vary depending on individual household usage.</li>
      <li>Consider installing a residential circulation pump to save water. </li>
      <li>Install aerating, low-flow faucets and showerheads.</li>
    </ol>
